Addition / Subtraction / Multiplication and Division is supported natively. Strings Strings in lox are to be enclosed in double-inverted commas. String concatenation is supported through the + operator Example var a = \"Hello \"; var b = \"World\"; var c = a + b; // c contains \"Hello World\" Variables Variables are declared and assigned with the following syntax var <variable_name> ; var <variable_name> = <expresssion>; Example var a; var b = 16; Until the value of the variable is intialized, it holds the value nil Warning Note : Redeclaring variables is only allowed in the global scope. Any attempt to redeclare variables in a local scope will lead to an error. Assignment Variable assignnments are considered to be expressions by lox and thus return the value that is being assigned. This allows for chained assignment. Example var a; var b; var c; c = b = a = 5; Booleans Booleans in lox are denoted by true and false . Truthiness In lox only nil and false are Falsy values. Every other value is considered to be Truthy. Example : if (12) { print \"Yes\"; } // Yes If-else statements Syntax if (<condition>) { <statements> } else { <statements> } If the block has only one statement, the braces can be ommitted.

Using this in static methods will throw an error. Constructor The constructor of the class can be defined through init . Each of the methods of the classes are defined the same way functions are defined with the only change being that we dont use the fun keyword. Note that in case of a class having a parent class, when the object for the class is initialized, only the constructor for the subclass is called automatically. If one wishes to call the constructor of the parent class, they can do so with super . An example of this is shown in the Inheritance section. Static methods Lox has support for static methods, which can directly be called from the class without instantiating an object for that class. All such methods must be prefixed with the static . Example: class Math{ init() { print \"math module initialized\"; } static square(a){ return a * a; } static min(a, b){ if (a < b) return a; return b; } static max(a, b){ if (a > b) return a; return b; } static abs(a){ return a > 0 ? a : -a; } } print Math.square(6); print Math.min(10, 5); print Math.max(782, 37349); print Math.abs(-92); Inheritance Lox has support for single - inheritance. During the definintion of the class the parent class is to be specified after the < token. All the methods of the parent class including the constructor are available to the child class.
